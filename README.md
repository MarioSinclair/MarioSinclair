## 💻 About Me

I'm a Junior Computer Science student at the University of South Florid, passionate about bridging creativity and technical problem-solving through code. I focus on full-stack development and quantitative modeling.

 I’m also deeply interested in robotics and autonomous navigation, currently an Undergraduate researcher at the USF Reality, Autonomy and Robot Experience Lab (RARELab).

## 🧠 Interests & Projects

- **Autonomous Driving**: Building CNNs to differentiate between binary image inputs.
- **Full-Stack Development**: 
  - Led the end-to-end development of the [USF NSBE website](https://www.usfnsbe.com/), from initial concept and design to deployment and ongoing maintenance.
  - Developed a [full-stack web application](https://black-scholes-pricing-ruddy.vercel.app/) for pricing financial options. This tool implements the Black-Scholes model on the backend to analyze and visualize complex derivatives.
- **Finance & Modeling**: Developing tools for pricing options using mathematical models.
- **Embedded Systems**: Gaining hands-on experience with microcontrollers (TI MSP430, Arduino Uno Rev3) and low-level programming (C, MSP430 Assembly Language).
